cell:
  name: "Damp Stone Cell"
  description: |
    You wake up on a hard slab in a damp stone cell. The air is cold and smells strongly of brine and mold.
    Iron bars block the north exit. The only other object is a cracked, moss-covered **Stone Slab** near your feet.
    
    [DM NOTE: The setting is intentionally sparse to encourage interacting with the two main objects (Bars, Slab).]

    # EXIT LOGIC: Requires the player to find the 'shiv' and use it to 'unlock' the door.
