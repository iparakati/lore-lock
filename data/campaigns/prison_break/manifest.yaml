# DM PRIMER: THE CAMPAIGN HOOK (Why are they here?)
# ==========================================
hook: |
  The player is a political prisoner, captured for opposing the iron-fisted Warden. 
  The immediate goal is not revenge, but self-preservation: ESCAPE THE PRISON FACILITY.
  The facility is built into a cliffside, meaning failure to escape quietly can lead to
  deadly consequences (e.g., being thrown off the cliff).
